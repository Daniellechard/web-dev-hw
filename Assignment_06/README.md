<h1>Questions</h1>
Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?
  I come across email subscription forms the most when I am browsing the web because almost every site has one that pop ups before you can even look at the products on their site.
List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.
  A text input would be things such as comment boxes or email subscription boxes

  A selection input example would be selecting yes or no option bubbles or check boxes

  A button input example would be a subscribe, submit, or search button

  This week was one of the more confusing weeks but I think I have a decent grasp of the information. I am glad we got to use a little bit of color this week and hope we will learn more about the aesthetics of web dev soon.
