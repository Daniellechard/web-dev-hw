<h1>Color</h1>
<br>Briefly describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types.
When might you choose one over the other to style content?
A universal selector selects each element "universally" in the code, hence the name. It is great for changing many things at once and creating consistency. Element selectors, class selectors, and id selectors select individual elements, classes and id's. These are great for tailoring things the exact way you want and creating distinction.</br>
<br>Describe your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes
Lime Green: rgb(232, 255, 177), E8FFB1
Orange: rgb(239, 103, 8), EF6708
Deep Blue: rgb(8, 19, 81), 081351</br>

<br>Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
First I read through the content and requirements. Then I looked through each decades images and decided on the 90s because that's when I was born. Next I selected which images I wanted to use and which background color would suit them. I ended up having to go into office hours for help on changing the size of one of the images. </br>
