      <h1>Homemade Bread Recipe</h1>

<div class="instructions">

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <p>Dissolve the yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl with a pinch of sugar. When the yeast bubbles add the sugar, salt, oil,
          and 4 cups of flour, and stir till smooth.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <p>Add the rest of the flour, 1/2 cup at a time. The dough should slightly stick to your fingers when you touch it. Knead dough for 5-7 minutes and then form it into a ball.</p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
          <p>Place the kneaded dough into a lightly oiled bowl and turn it so that all sides are coated. Then cover it with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for 1 hour.</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
          <p>After the dough has risen for 1 hour divide it in half. Roll each half into a long cyclinder to fit into your bread pan.</p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
          <p>Place the dough into lightly greased bread pans with the seam facing down and cover with plastic wrap again. Let the dough rise for another hour.</p>

        <h3>Step 6</h3>
          <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and bake for 30-35 minutes or until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow to the touch. Brush them with melted butter and let cool before slicing.</p>
