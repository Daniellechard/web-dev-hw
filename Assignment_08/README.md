<h1>Questions</h1>
An imaginary client has come to you for a site design. Fill in the blanks of this conversation: "My company's name is Nurse Nanny and we offer nanny service by certified nurses. Our brand colors are pastel yellow, light blue, and white and two words to describe the theme of the website are clean and soft." Decide on the color, fonts, and layout of this site based off these needs.
