  <p>I went to the site "GameForge" and it has changed significantly since 2004. In it's early stages it seems to be all in German but now they have options that allow the site to be displayed in many different languages, including English. Early GameForge was also lacking color, images,and structure, all of which the new and improved site has. In fact, most of the homepage is covered in different game images that cycle through automatically.
