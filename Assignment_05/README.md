  <h5><li> A document should only have 1 head and 1 body element to cause less confusion and to allow the code to run more smoothly. The head element serves as the informational part of the code that other users won't see in the finished product whereas the body element displays anything that you want to appear on your finished webpage.</li>
  <li> Structural markup helps do just what is says in its name by adding structure to your work such as headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. Semantic markup on the other hand helps with the finer details such as adding emphasis or details to different parts of your document through italics, definitions, quotes, etc.</li>
  <li>I liked learning about the lists and I enjoy using semantic markup to help emphasize different words and key phrases. My work cycle consisted of reading through the material and then going down the list and completing the steps one by one. If I ran in to trouble I would just look at other student examples or just go back and re-read the material.</li></h5>
