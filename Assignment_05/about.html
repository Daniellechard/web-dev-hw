      Erin Hanson is a 19 year old poet living in Australia. She started writing poetry around the age of 12 and tries to read various genres to gain inspiration for her poems. She usually finds a theme she wants to base her poem on and then comes up with the last  two to four lines first. From there she starts back at the beginning and compares writing poetry to weaving metaphors because she already knows where she's going to end.
