      <h1>Not Perfect</h1>


<div class="Quote">


          <p>"<span>He’s</span> not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if <span>he</span> can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if <span>he</span> admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. <span>He</span> isn’t going to quote poetry, <span>he’s</span> not thinking about you every moment, but <span>he</span> will give you a part of him that <span>he</span> knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than <span>he</span> can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when <span>he</span> makes you happy, yell when <span>he</span> makes you mad, and miss him when <span>he’s</span> not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you."</p>
