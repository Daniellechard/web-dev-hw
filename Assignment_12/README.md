<h1>Typography</h1>
  <p>Briefly share your design process for this assignment.
  What fonts did you choose, and why?
  I chose Oswlard because I like the clean, modern look paired with the handwritten look of the Permanent Marker font.
  What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
  System Font=font within operating System
  Web Font=font located on the web that you host by embedding into your code
  Web-Safe Font=font that is supported by most web browsers making it much safer to use and less likely to need a backup font
  Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
  I picked out my quote/writing first and then found fonts to pair with it. I also ended up going into office hours to get help because I couldn't figure out how to reference the sections I wanted in order to apply the seperate fonts.
