      <h1>Life can be Sunshine</h1>
        <h2>Erin Hanson</h2>
  <hr />

    <p>Life can be sunshine,</p>
    <p>On peaceful days with bright blue skys,</p>
    <p>Or life can be the raindrops,</p>
    <p>That fall like tears squeezed from your eyes,</p>
    <p>Life can be the heaven,</p>
    <p>That you'll only reach through hell,</p>
    <p>Since you won't know that you're happy,</p>
    <p>If you've not been sad as well,</p>
    <p>Life can teach hard lessons,</p>
    <p>But you'll be wiser once you know,</p>
    <p>That even roses need both sunshine,<p/>
    <p>And a touch of rain to grow.</p>
