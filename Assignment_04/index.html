      <h1>Life can be Sunshine</h1>
        <h2>Erin Hanson</h2>
  <hr />

    <p>Life can be sunshine,
       On peaceful days with bright blue skys,
       Or life can be the raindrops,
       That fall like tears squeezed from your eyes,
       Life can be the heaven,
       That you'll only reach through hell,
       Since you won't know that you're happy,
       If you've not been sad as well,
       Life can teach hard lessons,
       But you'll be wiser once you know,
       That even roses need both sunshine,
       And a touch of rain to grow.
